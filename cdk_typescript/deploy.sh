# This script will deploy all stacks in this project and can used only for initial deployment.
# Deployment is done in two passes. First time CloudWAN is deployed with initial policy file cloudwan-policy-init.json
# and all other stacks are deployed normally.
# In second pass, a TS code is run to get all CloudWAN attachments for inspection VPCs and then those are
# added to the active policy. New policy is then deployed to AWS by running CDK deploying CloudWAN stack again.
